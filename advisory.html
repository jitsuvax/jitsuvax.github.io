								<p> The EAB provides an independent angle on the research, giving critical analysis and suggestions throughout the project. They act as a consultation body for the JITSUVAX consortium and their feedback is critical to the success of the project. Their expertise and experience will provide JITSUVAX with meaningful insights into the interests and views of their stakeholder communities. The members of the EAB will be strategically involved in key stages of JITSUVAX, ensuring that the needs of the stakeholders are at the forefront and paving the way for the effective uptake of the results. </p>
